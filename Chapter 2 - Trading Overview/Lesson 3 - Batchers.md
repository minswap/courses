Cardano’s unique Extended UTXO (eUTxO) model means decentralised exchanges (DEXs) like Minswap must handle transactions differently than Ethereum-based platforms.

Instead of each user transaction directly interacting with smart contracts, Minswap uses batchers — off-chain services that collect multiple swap requests, bundle them, and submit a single transaction to the Cardano blockchain.

What Are Batchers?
Batchers play a crucial role in the Cardano DEX ecosystem by:

Collecting swap requests from users
Efficiently batching multiple trades into a single transaction
Submitting that transaction to the blockchain on the users’ behalf
This system improves throughput, reduces congestion, and optimises transaction efficiency on-chain.

Why Were Batcher Fees Charged?
Batchers have traditionally charged a small fee (previously around 2 ADA per order on Minswap) to:

Cover the cost of transaction fees on the Cardano network
Incentivise operators who maintain and run the batching infrastructure
Minswap’s 0 Batcher Fee Update
As of May 2025, to celebrate its third anniversary, Minswap has removed all batcher fees for users. Trades now only incur the regular Cardano network fee, making swaps cheaper than ever.

This change is expected to:

Increase trading activity
Lower barriers to entry for new users
Stimulate more liquidity provision
Minswap’s decision underscores its commitment to user experience and to building a more accessible, cost-efficient DeFi environment on Cardano.
