2. **Transfer ADA to Your Wallet**  
   Log into your exchange account (e.g., Binance) or another wallet where you hold ADA.

3. **Send ADA to Your MinWallet**  
   Use the copied address to send ADA to your MinWallet. Ensure you send enough ADA to cover transaction fees and any trades you plan to make.
