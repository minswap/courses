# What is a Limit Order?

A limit order is a trade order that allows users to buy or sell assets at a specific price or better. Unlike market orders, executed immediately at the current market price, limit orders give traders more control by setting a predefined price at which the trade will be executed. This feature ensures that users only buy or sell an asset if it reaches their desired price point, which can be beneficial in managing risk and optimising trade outcomes.

## Limit Orders vs. Market Orders

- **Limit Orders**: Allow users to set specific prices for their trades, but the trade is not guaranteed to be executed unless the market reaches the desired price.  
- **Market Orders**: These are executed immediately at the current market price but offer no control over the price, potentially resulting in higher costs or lower returns due to slippage.

## How Limit Orders Work

**Buying with a Limit Order**:  
When placing a limit order to buy an asset, the user specifies the maximum price they are willing to pay. The trade will only be executed if the market price drops to that level or below. For example, if a user sets a limit order to buy Token A at 1.00 ADA, the order will not be executed unless the price of Token A falls to 1.00 ADA or lower.

**Selling with a Limit Order**:  
When placing a limit order to sell an asset, the user sets the minimum price they are willing to sell. The trade will only occur if the market price rises to meet or exceed that level. For instance, if a user wants to sell Token B at 2.00 ADA, the order will only be filled if the price of Token B reaches 2.00 ADA or higher.

## Key Benefits of Limit Orders

- **Price Control**: Limit orders allow users to control the price at which their trades are executed. This can be especially useful in volatile markets, where prices fluctuate rapidly.  
- **Risk Management**: By setting a limit order, traders can ensure they don’t overpay for an asset or sell it for less than they want. This allows for more strategic trading decisions and helps avoid the risks of sudden market movements.  
- **Avoiding Slippage**: Since limit orders are only executed at or better than the specified price, they help traders avoid slippage—the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which it is executed.  
- **Passive Trading Strategy**: Limit orders allow for a “set and forget” approach. Traders can place their orders and wait for the market to reach the desired price without constantly monitoring market conditions.

## Example of a Limit Order in Action

**Buying Example**:  
A user wants to buy 100 tokens of $SNEK, but the current price is 10 ADA per token, which they feel is too high. The user sets a limit order at 8 ADA, meaning the trade will only execute if the price of $SNEK drops to 8 ADA or lower. If the market reaches this price, the order will be automatically filled.

**Selling Example**:  
A user holds 200 tokens of $SNEK, currently valued at 5 ADA per token. They want to sell only if the price reaches 6 ADA. The user sets a limit order to sell at 6 ADA, ensuring the trade will only occur when the price hits or exceeds this target.

> We can all wish the $SNEK memecoin were at 6 ADA per token.
