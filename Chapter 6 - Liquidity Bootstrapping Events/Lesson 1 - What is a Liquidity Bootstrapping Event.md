# What is a Liquidity Bootstrapping Event?

A Liquidity Bootstrapping Event (LBE) is a fair launch mechanism used on Minswap to:

- Distribute a new token to the public  
- Bootstrap liquidity for a trading pair  
- Set an initial market-driven price  
- Prevent front-running and whale dominance

## How It Works

### No Starting Price  
Unlike fixed-price launches, the token starts with zero liquidity and no set price.

### Dual Token Pool  
- The team or project provides the new token (e.g., $XYZ).  
- Participants contribute ADA during the LBE window.

### Price Discovery Phase  
- As more ADA is added, the price of the new token dynamically increases.  
- Larger contributors must pay more per token, incentivising early participation and wider distribution.

### Token Allocation  
- At the end of the event, ADA and the new token form a trading pair pool on Minswap.  
- Participants get LP tokens representing their share.

## Benefits of Minswapâ€™s LBE Model

### Fair and Transparent Distribution  
- Prevents sniping and early insider access

### Community-Led Price Discovery  
- Token price is based on supply/demand during the event

### Instant Liquidity Post-LBE  
- Tokens are tradable immediately with deep initial liquidity

### Decentralised and Permissionless  
- Anyone can participate using a Cardano wallet

### Integration with Yield Farming  
After an LBE, the LP tokens can often be:

- Staked in farms to earn MIN rewards  
- Used in other DeFi strategies within the Cardano ecosystem
