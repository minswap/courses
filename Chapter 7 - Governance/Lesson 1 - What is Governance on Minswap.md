# What is Governance on Minswap?

Minswap is governed by its community through a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) model, allowing token holders to propose, vote, and decide on key protocol changes and developments.

- The native token **$MIN** is used for voting.  
- Anyone holding $MIN can participate.  
- Voting is done on-chain for transparency and immutability.

## How Minswap Governance Works

### Proposal Submission  
Community members can create and submit proposals (e.g., fee structure changes, new farming pools, treasury usage).  
Proposals are first discussed off-chain (e.g., Governance Forum) before going on-chain.

### Snapshot Voting  
Voting typically takes place via a snapshot mechanism based on wallet balances at a specific block.  
You vote using your $MIN tokens – the more you hold, the more weight your vote has.

### Execution  
If a proposal passes the required quorum and majority, it is implemented by the core team or via smart contract automation.
